# AI-Powered Food Ordering Assistant  
This agent will help with the ordering food process. A case study is conducted on Glovo to ensure as little as possible is spent searching for what to eat on the website. It will also help streamline the ordering process and facilitate the delivery of promotions quickly.


## The Problem  

Ordering food online should be simple but it often isn’t.  

- You’re stuck scrolling through endless menus.  
- Search tools feel hard to use, and filters rarely capture exactly what you want.  
- You waste time figuring out which items fit your taste, budget, or dietary needs.  
- Switching between apps, menus, and payment options kills the convenience.  

In short, you spend more time **deciding** than **eating**.  

## The Solution  

This project introduces a conversational food ordering assistant powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.  
Instead of clicking through menus, you can simply **chat naturally**, the way you’d talk to a friend:  

- **Tell it what you’re craving**: *"I’m in the mood for spicy noodles under 20,000 UGX."*  
- **Get smart recommendations**: It searches the menu intelligently, matching your taste, budget, and dietary preferences.  
- **Skip the hassle**: The assistant handles the flow from finding the right item to confirming your order, all in one conversation.  

No more rigid interfaces or endless scrolling — just **quick, personalised ordering in plain language**.  


## Why It Matters  

By turning menu navigation into a simple conversation, this assistant makes food ordering:  

- **Faster**, no need to dig through dozens of pages.  
- **Smarter**, understands context and preferences.
